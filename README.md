##  Python useful code

So awhile ago, I started to program in python (particularly, version 3).  Soon thereafter, I decided to create this repository with the purpose of record some programs that I developed and found pragmatic.

##  Organization of the Files

The project has the following structure:
  * **_CODES**: Contains the python codes classified by topic.
    * **_EXCEL**: Related code for the management of Excel files.
  * **_RESOURCES**: Include some relevant files that were used during the creation of the codes.

##  Setup

In some cases, you will need to use an external module so as to use the python codes, so you could install the requiered package with the following commands:

  * On Windows

    - For python 2: `python  -m pip install <package-name>`
    - For python 3: `python3 -m pip install <package-name>`

  N.B.: `pip` is already installed in newer versions of python.
